# Learning Astro

> by [parsehex](https://parsehex.github.io)

This is an Astro site that I created with the goal of actually learning how Astro works, rather than letting AI guide me as I've done for my projects [SrcGallery](https://github.com/ProjectDepot/SrcGallery) and [dailyfalsefacts](https://github.com/parsehex/dailyfalsefacts).

I'm following [this tutorial](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial) from the Astro docs, at least to start.
